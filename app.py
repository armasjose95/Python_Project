# decimal point notation
# when an integer is divided by another, the result is not necessarily an integer.
# The rule in Python is to return a number with a decimal point and a fractional part, even when the result is an integer

#Boolean expressions can be combined together using Boolean operators and , or , and not to form larger Boolean expressions.#
# AND Operator
# The and operator applied to two Boolean expressions will evaluate to True if both expressions evaluate to True;
# if either expression evaluates to False, then it will evaluate to False:

2 < 3 and 4 > 5  # = False, both not true
2 < 3 and 1 < 4  # = True, both are true

# OR Operator
# The or operator applied to two Boolean expressions evaluates to False only when both expressions are false.
# If either one is true or if both are true, then it evaluates to True.

3 < 4 or 4 < 3  # = True, one of these are true
3 < 2 or 2 < 1  # = False, both are false

# NOT Operator
# The not operator is a unary Boolean operator,
# which means that it is applied to a single Boolean expression (as opposed to the binary Boolean operators and and or).
# It evaluates to False if the expression is true or to True if the expression is false.

not (3 < 4)  # = False
not (3 > 4)  # = True
not (4 < 3)  # = True

# assigning names to values is called Variables
# statement x=3 is called an assignment statement.
# The general format of an assignment statement is:
# <variable> = <expression>
# variable x can be thought of as a name that enables us to retrieve value 3 later on.
x = 3
x  # or print(x)    = 3

4 * x  # = 12

# An expression involving variables may appear on the right side of an assignment
counter = 4 * x
# In statement counter = 4 * x, x is first evaluated to 3,
# Then the expression 4 * 3 is evaluated to 12, and then 12 gets assigned to variable counter:
counter  # or print(counter) = 12

# Practice Problems
# (a) Assign integer value 3 to variable a.
a = 3
# (b) Assign 4 to variable b.
b = 4
# (c) Assign to variable c the value of expression a * a + b * b
c = a*a + b*b

# the value of a variable can change
# variable x is initially 3: print(x) =  3

# Strings
# a sequence of characters, including blanks, punctuation, and various symbols.
# A string value is represented as a sequence of characters that is enclosed within quotes:
'Hello, World!'
s = "hello"
s  # = 'hello'

# String Operators
s == 'hello'  # = true because we assigned variable s to string 'hello'
t = 'world'
s != t  # = True because s does NOT EQUAL t
s == t  # = false. S='hello' and t='world'

# the comparison operators < and > compare strings using the dictionary(alphabetical) order:
s < t  # = true. S comes b4 t
s > t  # = false. s is before T so not after

# Concatenation
# the joining of the two strings:
s + t  # = 'helloworld'
# ' ' quotes with a space between creates space between strings
s + ' ' + t  # = 'hello world'


# check whether a character appears in a string:
s = 'hello'
'h' in s  # = true. 'h' is in hello
'g' in s  # = false. 'g' is not in hello


# Length of a string
# The length of a string can be computed using the len() function:
len(s)  # = 5 bcus 'hello' is 5 characters long

# Practice Problems
s1 = 'ant'
s2 = 'bat'
s3 = 'cod'
# Write Python expressions using s1, s2, and s3 and operators + and * that evaluate to:

# (a) 'ant bat cod'
s1 + ' ' + s2 + ' ' + s3
# (b) 'ant ant ant ant ant ant ant ant ant ant '
(s1 + ' ') * 10
# (c) 'ant bat bat cod cod cod'
s1 + ' ' + (s2 + ' ') * 2 + ' ' + (s3 + ' ') * 3
# (d) 'ant bat ant bat ant bat ant bat ant bat ant bat ant bat '
(s1 + ' ' + s2 + ' ') * 7
# (e) 'batbatcod batbatcod batbatcod batbatcod batbatcod '
((s2 * 2) + s3 + ' ') * 5    # or (s2+s2+s3+' ') * 5


# Indexing Operator
# The individual characters of a string can be accessed using the indexing operator. Starts from 0 -> on.
s[0]  # = h
s[1]  # = e
s[4]  # = o

# Practice Problem 2.5
z = '0123456789'
# Now write expressions using string s and the indexing operator that evaluate to:
# (a) '0'
z[0]
# (b) '1'
z[1]
# (c) '6'
z[6]
# (d) '8'
z[8]
# (e) '9'
z[9]


# Negative indexes
# may be used to access the characters from the back (right side) of the string.
# The index −1 refers to the last character;
# so s[-1] evaluates to string 'o'. s[-2] evaluates to 'l'.
s  # = hello
s[-1]  # = o
s[-2]  # = l
s[-5]  # = h


#Lists and Tuples
# In Python, lists are usually stored in a type of object called a list.
# A list is a sequence of objects.
# The objects can be of any type: numbers, strings, even other lists.

pets = ['goldfish', 'cat', 'dog']
pets  # = ['goldfish' , 'cat', 'dog']
pets[2]  # = 'dog'

things = ['one', 2, [3, 4]]
# 'one' = string
# 2 = integer
# [3,4] = list
things[0]  # = 'one'
things[2]  # = [3,4]


# List Operators
# items in A list may be accessed individually using the indexing operator,
# just as individual characters can be accessed in a string:

pets[0]  # ='goldfish'
pets[1]  # ='cat'
# Negative Indexes for List operators
pets[-1]  # = 'dog'

# Length of a list
len(pets)  # = 3

# Adding/Concatenating and multiplying lists
# Like strings, lists can be “added,” meaning that they can be concatenated.

pets + pets  # = ['goldfish', 'cat', 'dog', 'goldfish', 'cat', 'dog']
pets * 2  # = ['goldfish', 'cat', 'dog', 'goldfish', 'cat', 'dog']

# Check for an object inside a string
# IN
# you can use the in operator in a Boolean expression that evaluates
'rabbit' in pets  # = false
'dog' in pets  # = true

# Operators used commonly in lists
gas = [2.99, 3.49, 2.79, 3.75]
min(gas)  # = 2.79
max(gas)  # = 3.75
sum(gas)  # = 13.02

# Practice Problem 2.6
# First execute the assignment
words = ['bat', 'ball', 'barn', 'basket', 'badminton']
# Now write two Python expressions that evaluate to the first and last, respectively, word in words, in dictionary(a-z) order.
min(words)  # = 'badminton'
max(words)  # = 'bat'


# Lists Are Mutable, Strings Are Not
# Lists are mutable and the content of a list can be changed.
# ex. want to change the type of cat in the list pets
pets[1] = "Brown cat"
pets  # or print(pets) = ['goldfish' , 'Brown Cat', 'dog']

# Strings aren't mutable. What that means is that we cannot change the individual characters of a string value.
# But..We can simply reassign a brand new value to any variable.
myCat = 'Brown bat'
myCat = 'Brown cat'
print(myCat)  # = 'Brown Cat'


# Tuples/Immutable Lists
# behave like lists except that tuples are immutable.
# A tuple object contains a sequence of values separated by commas and enclosed in parentheses ( ) instead of brackets [ ]:

days = ('Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed')
print(days)  # = ('Mon' , 'Tue', 'Wed')
days = ('Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu')
days  # = ('Mon' , 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu')

# All operators work in tuples as well
'Fri' in days  # = false
week = days + ('Fri', 'Sat', 'Sun')
week  # = ('Mon' , 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri', 'Sat', 'Sun')
len(week)  # = 7
2*week  # = ('Mon' , 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri', 'Sat', 'Sun', 'Mon' , 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri', 'Sat', 'Sun')

days[2]  # = 'Wed'

# Create a one element tuple?
# add a comma after the first, and only, item to get a one-item tuple object:
day = ('Mon',)
type(day)  # = tuple

# List and Tuple Methods
# There are also functions that are called on lists.
# Add a string to the list

pets.append('cow')
pets  # = ['goldfish', 'Brown cat', 'dog', 'cow']

pets.append('dog')
print(pets)  # = ['goldfish', 'Brown cat', 'dog', 'cow', 'dog']

# append()
# Append can't be called on it's own, needs to be called on some list.
# List functions like append are known as methods.
# List function: COUNT
pets.count('dog')  # = 2

# remove()
# To remove the first occurrence of 'dog', we can use the list method remove():
pets.remove('dog')
pets  # = ['goldfish', 'Brown cat', 'cow', 'dog']

# reverse()
# The list method reverse() reverses the order of the objects:
pets.reverse()
pets  # = ['dog', 'cow', 'Brown cat', 'goldfish']

# sort()
# The sort() method sorts the items in the list in increasing order,
# using the ordering that “naturally” applies to the objects in the list.
# If the list contains string objects, the order will be lexicographical(i.e., dictionary order(a-z)):
pets.sort()
pets  # = ['Brown cat', 'cow', 'dog' , 'goldfish']

nums = [4, 2, 8, 5]
nums.sort()  # =[2, 4 , 5, 8]

# Practice Problem 2.7
grades = [9, 7, 7, 10, 3, 9, 6, 6, 2]
# (a) An expression that evaluates to the number of 7 grades
grades.count(7)  # = 2
# (b) A statement that changes the last grade to 4
grades[-1] = 4
# or
grades.remove(2)
grades.append(4)
grades  # = [9, 7, 7, 10, 3, 9, 6, 6, 4]
# (c) An expression that evaluates to the maximum grade
max(grades)  # = 10
# (d) A statement that sorts the list grades
grades.sort()
grades  # = [3,4,6,6,7,7,9,9,10]
# (e) An expression that evaluates to the average grade
averageGrades = sum(grades)/len(grades)
print(averageGrades)

# The only tuple methods that can be used are count() & index() since tuples are immutable.


#Objects and Classes
# In Python, every value, whether a simple integer value (such as 3) or a more complex
# value (such as the string 'Hello, World!' or the list ['hello', 4, 5]) is stored in memory as an object.

# Object’s type-indicates what kind of values the object can hold and what kind of operations can be performed on the object.
type(3)  # = int type
type(3.0)  # = Float type
type('Hello World')  # = Str Type
type([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])  # = List Type

# When used on a variable, the type() function will return the type of the object the variable refers to:
p = 3
type(p)  # = int type

# Class-refer to types whose values are stored in objects.
# Because every value in Python is stored in an object, every Python type is a class.

2 - 3 + 1  # = 0
# a good developer would use parentheses to clearly indicate her intent:
(2-3) + 1  # = 0


# Practice Problem 2.8
# In what order are the operators in the following expressions evaluated?
# (a) 2 + 3 == 4 or a >= 5
((2+3) == 4) or (a >= 5)  # = False
# (b) x[1] * -3 < -10 == 0
(((x[1]) * (-3)) < (-10)) == 0
#(c) (x[1] * -3 < -10) in [0, True]
(((x[1]) * (-3)) < (-10)) in [0, True]
# (d) 2 * 3**2
2 * (3**2)
# (e) 4 / 2 in [1, 2, 3]
(4/2) in [1, 2, 3]


# Creating Objects
# To create an integer object with value 3 (and assign it to variable x), we can use this statement:
x = 3
# Python also supports a way to create objects that makes the object type explicit:
x = int(3)
print(x)  # = 3

# The function int() is called a constructor; it is used to explicitly instantiate an integer object.
# The value of the object is determined by the function argument:
# If no argument is given, a default value is given to the object.


x = int()
print(x)  # = 0

y = float()
print(y)  # = 0.0

s = str()
print(s)  # = ' '

z = list()
print(z)  # = []


# Implicit Type Conversions
# If an algebraic or logical expression involves operands of different types,
# Python will convert each operand to the type that contains the others.

True + 5  # = 6
True + 5.0  # = 6.0


# Explicit Type Conversions
# Type conversions can also be done explicitly using the constructor functions.

int(3.4)  # = 3
int(-3.6)  # = -3

float(3)  # = 3.0

str(2.72)  # = '2.72'


# Practice Problems 2.9
# (a) False + False
False + False  # = 0 Integer Value
# (b) 2 * 3**2.0
2 * 3**2.0  # = 18.0 Float Value
# (c) 4 // 2 + 4 % 2
4 // 2 + 4 % 2  # = 2 Int Value
# (d) 2 + 3 == 4 or 5 >= 5
2 + 3 == 4 or 5 >= 5  # = True Boolean Value


# Class Methods
# Pets = Object which is a list
# Append = Method
# Pig = 'String'
pets.append('pig')


# Python Standard Library
# The Standard Library includes modules to support, among others:
# Network programming
# Web application programming
# Graphical user interface (GUI) development
# Database programming
# Mathematical functions
# Pseudorandom number generators
# Module Math


# Module Math
# The math module is a library of mathematical constants and functions.
# To use a math module function, the module must first be explicitly imported:
# import math

math.sqrt(9)

# Practice Problem 2.10
# Write Python expressions corresponding to the following:
# (a) The length of the hypotenuse in a right triangle whose other two sides have lengths a and b
math.sqrt((a**2) + (b**2))
# (b) The value of the expression that evaluates whether the length of the above hypotenuse is 5
math.sqrt((a**2) + (b**2)) == (5)
# (c) The area of a disk of radius a
math.pi * (a**2)
# (d) The value of the Boolean expression that checks whether a point with coordinates x
# and y is inside a circle with center (a, b) and radius r
(x - a)**2 + (y - b)**2 < r ** 2
