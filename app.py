# define a function in Python . Steps
# 1. def stands for define. How you define your own function
# 2. then whatever name you want to use for your function
# 3. put () at the end of the function
# 4. end with :
# hit enter and start defining the body of that function. what function does
# anything after : is actually ran
# run a function by writing function name

# for loop
